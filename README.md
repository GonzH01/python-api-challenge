- The project WeatherPy, aims to explore how different weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, vary with latitude. By investigating the relationship between these weather variables and latitude, the project provides insights into how geographical location influences weather patterns. It serves as a practical example of how to handle API data fetching, data manipulation with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, and performing statistical analysis.
  - Accessing weather data requires a unique API key registration from the ([OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)), which should be formatted into the api_keys file.
- This project VacationPy, involves creating an interactive map to visualize weather conditions in various cities and locating hotels in cities with ideal weather conditions. The script uses a CSV file containing weather data for multiple cities, which includes information such as temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness. This script can serve as a template for developers or analysts in the tourism and travel industry, providing a framework for integrating weather data and accommodation searches.
  - Accessing geoapify data requires a unique API key registration from the ([Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/get-started-with-maps-api)), which should also be formatted into the api_keys file.
